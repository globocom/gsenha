Architecture:
----------------------

All communication must be over TLS. You should not use a self-signed certificate. In every request from the front-end to the API the certificate is verified. If the verification fails the request will not work.

![alt text](docs/images/diagram_gsenha.png)

Logs:
----

All requests are logged in this format:
	
	In case of success:
		action=|api path| user=|username| src=|source address| result=|success|

	In case of failure:
		action=|api path| desc=|error description| result=|error| user=|username| src=|source address|

All logs are sent to stdout.

User guide:
=============================

Login:
------

If you are already a member just go to login page and use your LDAP's credentials and your private key (**IT WILL NEVER LEAVE YOUR BROWSER**).

![alt text](docs/images/login.png)

If you are not a member yet you must have a key pair. In order to generate it:

Private key:

$ openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 4096

![alt text](docs/images/privkey.png)

The file should be named "privkey.pem" and should begins with "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----" and ends with "-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----".

and the public key:

$ openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem

![alt text](docs/images/pubkey.png)

The file should be named "public.pem" and should begins with "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----" and ends with "-----END PUBLIC KEY-----".

After generating your key pair you can add yourself. Your username and password should be the same as your LDAP's credentials.
